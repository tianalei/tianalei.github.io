title: A GIS-based Method for Subgrade Compaction Management (BSc. Thesis)
tags: PostgreSQL, PL/pgSQL, WebGIS
description: >
    I developed a GIS-based real-time monitoring system that enables dynamic quality assessment of subgrade compaction through spatial analysis of compactor trajectories. The system features an innovative incremental update algorithm that dramatically improved geometric data processing efficiency from minutes to milliseconds, along with a web-based platform for real-time visualization and anomaly detection.
