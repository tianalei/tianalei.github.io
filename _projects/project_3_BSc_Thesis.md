title: Spatial Database System for Subgrade Compaction Monitoring with WebGIS Visualization (BSc. Thesis)
tags: PostgreSQL, PL/pgSQL, WebGIS
description: >
    I developed a real-time monitoring system that enables dynamic quality assessment of subgrade compaction through spatial analysis of compactor trajectories. The system features an innovative incremental update technique that improved geometric data processing efficiency from minutes to milliseconds, along with a web-based platform for real-time visualization and anomaly detection.
