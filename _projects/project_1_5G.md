title: A Localization Approach Based on 5G Cellular Signaling Data and Individual Spatio-temporal Behavior
tags: Python, QGIS, Data Analysis
description: >
    We developed a two-stage approach that significantly improved building-level user positioning accuracy using 5G mobile signal data. The solution combines cellular signal metrics with users' spatio-temporal behavior patterns and building functionalities, effectively addressing the challenge of low-precision 5G MR data for accurate building-user linking.
