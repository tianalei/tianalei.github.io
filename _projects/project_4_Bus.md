description: >
    We developed an intelligent ticketing system that enables automatic ticket verification through real-time BeiDou positioning and geofencing algorithms, eliminating manual ticket checking at scenic spots. The system features a modular design that ensures reliable performance and seamless tourist experience. I implemented API development for frontend-backend interaction, along with comprehensive database design and development.
